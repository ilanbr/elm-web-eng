Elminda developed this repository as skills indicator for candidates for Front End Web Engineers. The code was scaffolded with react-create-app https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app and also uses the official firebase SDK https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk.

Instructions:
Fork this repository to your github account (create an account if you don't have one).

Write code in React so that the unit tests pass, specifically the test "Form should enable dynamically adding elements to table". You're welcome to use any resources you like to help you.

Create a pull request with your work and assign it to jmjpro@gmail.com.

You will have two hours to complete the test.
